# OC-2ndProject

Scenario

As a newly established web developer, you are considering how to attract more clients. After doing some research, you found that the single most useful way to do that is to develop your online presence.

As a web developer, it makes sense for you to create your own website to test that theory! Since you don't want to pay for a server at first, you decide to host it using the Github Pages service. You immediately create an account on the website to try it out. Satisfied with how easy it was, you decide to do a bit more research to find out what makes a good online resume, and finally settle on this template:

You need to make sure that everyone can reach you, from any device, so remember to manage responsiveness between mobile and desktop!

Your website should feel like your own, and using a template makes it a bit too generic. Using Material Design colors, and Font Awesome, you decide to add a little personality to your website by changing the dominant color and the icons.
